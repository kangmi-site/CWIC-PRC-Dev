The National Defense Science and Technology Commission submitted a report to the Central Military Commission requesting the development of a marine survey vessel. This is also of great significance to the navy,which will make the Republic navy\'s shortcomings on survey ships,escort ships and logistics supply ships. Because the meeting was held on January 18th,1967,it was officially named Project 718."
