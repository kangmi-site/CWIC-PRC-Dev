According to preliminary data, between 200,000 and 600,000 people died as a result of the earthquake. According to Zhang Jun, director of the Shanghai Earthquake Bureau, the main cause of the massive damage was the lack of necessary seismic measures in the construction of buildings. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council sent a condolence delegation, headed by Premier Hua Guofeng, to the areas affected by the July 28 earthquake, to pay their respects to the victims. Funds from the central government\'s budget were immediately allocated for relief and reconstruction work, which has weakened the aftermath of the earthquake. Today\'s earthquake in Tangshan is the second largest in history after the 156-year earthquake in Shaanxi"

The terms \"disruption and sabotage\",\"ulterior motives\",\"thorough investigation\" and \"counter-revolutionary rumors\" in the notice further enraged the mourning crowd.On April 1, a poem that was widely circulated at the time appeared on the monument\:\"I want to hear the ghosts cry in sorrow, I cry the wolves laugh. Weeping for the heroes, raising our eyebrows and sheathing our swords.\"On April 2, a parade of employees of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Factory 109 carried four large wreaths dedicated to Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi and Yang Kaihui and four large poetry plaques, which read:\"The red heart has borne the fruit of victory, and the blue blood has blossomed into revolutionary flowers again. If the devil spews poisonous fire, we will catch the demon and fight the ghost.\".On April 3, after Jiangsu and Zhejiang, slogans against the \"Gang of Four\" began to appear on the streets of Beijing.The number of mourners at Tiananmen Square increased dramatically, with people giving speeches and chanting slogans against the \"Gang of Four\".On April 4, the Qingming Festival, mass mourning and protests reached a climax, and the authorities counted more than 2,000 wreaths.The people are no longer content to sympathize with Deng Xiaoping by mourning Zhou Enping,Using nostalgia for Yang Kaihui to implicitly disparage Jiang Qing,Instead, they wrote poems directly mocking the Gang of Four, naming and cursing them, and even slogans directly opposing Mao Zedong,Compare them to jackals, demons, ghosts, Empress Dowager Cixi, the White Bone Demon, and Feudal totalitarian emperor.The masses were dissatisfied with the low scale of mourning for Zhou Enlai, with Mao Zedong's decision to \"criticize Deng and counteract the right-leaning revisionist wind\", and with the Cultural Revolution.It was mainly the support of young intellectuals, especially the children of party bureaucrats, for the bourgeois line represented by Deng Xiaoping, but of course most of them were actually held hostage by the bourgeois line out of remembrance of Premier Zhou and dissatisfaction with some issues of the late Cultural Revolution."

Although the press and central government documents repeatedly declared that \:\"the Cultural Revolution has penetrated the hearts of the people\",and \"has achieved a great victory\", in reality, resistance to the Cultural Revolution persisted.This is reflected in the use and promotion of new cadres of the revolutionaries. This is a boycott of the revolutionaries, but also of the Cultural Revolution.This resistance, both invisible and visible, made Mao Zedong, the initiator of the Cultural Revolution, uneasy, which is why Mao would later say:Not many people approved of the Cultural Revolution, one of the two major events he did in his life.The revolutionaries who followed Mao's rebellion were worried that the fermentation of this anti-Cultural Revolutionary force would eventually develop into a powerful force that would negate the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionaries need to take their rightful place.Finally, the time came to fight back against the anti-Cultural Revolutionary forces, and that was the \"criticism of Lin and Confucius\" movement in 1974.In a conversation with Wang Hongwen and Zhang Chunqiao in July 1973, Mao Zedong linked the criticism of Lin Biao with the criticism of Confucianism, saying that Lin Biao, like the Kuomintang, respected Confucianism and opposed the law, and that in Chinese history, Legalism had moved forward, while Confucianism had driven backwards.This was the beginning of the movement to criticize Linlin and Confucius.On January 12, 1974, Wang Hongwen and Jiang Qing wrote to Mao Zedong, requesting that the compilation <Lin Biao and the Way of Confucius and Mencius>, compiled by Peking University and Tsinghua University be forwarded to the whole country, and Mao Zedong approved the forwarding.On January 18, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the document <Lin Biao and the Way of Confucius and Mencius>, as Document No. 1 of 1974. In this way, the movement to criticize Lin Biao and Confucius was launched from top to bottom.In this way, the movement to criticize Lin and criticize Confucius was launched from the top down. As the \"Criticize Lin and Criticize Confucius\" movement, the revolutionary factions at the local level, which had been forcibly suppressed by the army, started to struggle again, but both cohorts and battle groups were forbidden.There was still infighting and factional fighting in many places, and the bureaucrats went on strike again due to criticism, leading to a drop in production.

The original Luo served in this position, but at this time has been ancient for many years, how to mention Luo?When Zhou reacted, Mao smiled and said :\"It is better for Chunqiao to take up the post.\"Zhou then again raised the historical issue of Zhang's \"traitor\", and Mao's answer was four words:\"Already know.\"On March 1, 1975, after Zhang Chunqiao became the director of the General Political Department of the PLA, he talked about the theoretical study on the dictatorship of the proletariat that was being carried out nationwide at a seminar for directors of political departments of all major units of the army, and attracted Mao Zedong's attention.August 1958 Lushan meeting on the study of theory, which said :\"Theoretically we used to criticize dogmatism, but did not criticize the empiricism. Now, the main danger is empiricism.\"Zhang went on to say :\"As far as I can see, Chairman Mao's words are still valid.\"\"I'm afraid we still have to be wary of the danger of empiricism.\"At the same time, Yao Wenyuan, in his article <The Social Basis of Lin Biao's Anti-Party Group> published in the <Red Flag> magazine, also quoted this passage from Mao, arguing that\"the main danger is empiricism\".The editorial of <People's Daily> on March 21 <Leading cadres should take the lead to learn well> said that \"empiricism is the assistant of revisionism\", and that people who \"make mistakes of empiricism\",\"will easily follow the revisionist line\".On April 23, Mao Zedong made a statement:\"Opposing revisionism includes opposing empiricism and dogmatism, both of which are revisions of Marxism-Leninism, do not just mention one and let the other go.\"On April 27, at a meeting of the Politburo chaired by Deng Xiaoping, Deng made a fierce criticism of Zhang, Yao and others for opposing empiricism.He said\:"

 prc70s.98.d:0 "On April 1, the newspaper published Zhang Chunqiao's <On the Total Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie>.In addition to his earlier remarks on limiting the legal power of the bourgeoisie, the article also focuses on the question of the total dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.This historical experience of \"satellite in the sky and red flag on the ground\" should not be forgotten at any time, especially when we are determined to build a strong nation, the article said.It is sobering to see that there is still a danger of revision in China.Because not only the imperialists and social-imperialists do not forget to invade and subvert us, not only the old landed bourgeoisie is still alive and well, but also new bourgeois elements are being created every day, as Lenin said.It must be seen that our economic base is not yet solid, that bourgeois legal power has not yet been completely abolished in terms of ownership, that it still exists in a serious way in terms of people's mutual relations, and that it still dominates in terms of distribution.In all areas of the superstructure, some areas are still held by the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie is still dominant; some are being reformed, but the results of the reform are not consolidated; old ideas and old habits still obstruct the growth of new socialist things tenaciously.The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between the political forces and the ideological class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie was still long, tortuous and sometimes even fierce, as the urban and rural capitalist factors developed and new bourgeois elements arose one after another.Even if the old generation of landlords and bourgeoisie are all dead, this class struggle will never stop, Lin Biao and other figures to power, the restoration of the bourgeoisie, may still occur.It is proposed that \"whether it is a system of universal ownership or collective ownership, there is a problem of leadership\",The existence of bourgeois legal power would lead to the creation of \"new bourgeois elements one after another\"."

 prc70s.99.d:0 "In August 1975, Mao Zedong was in Hangzhou, his eyes were suffering from cataracts, his eyesight was poor, and he could not read, so he discussed with Ludi, a teacher in the Chinese Department of Peking University who was studying beside him, about the commentary on <Water Margin>.Mao Zedong sent a round of discussion, Lu was recorded and organized. August 14, Mao Zedong approved the official publication.The speech, which has been officially issued, is mainly\:\"<Water Margin> the book, good in surrender.To be a negative example, so that the people know the surrender faction. <Water Margin> only against corrupt officials, not against the emperor.\"After Yao Wenyuan saw Mao Zedong's comments on <Water Margin>, he wrote to Mao Zedong overnight, saying how he would propagate it in <People's Daily> and <Red Flag> magazines.It is said that the process from receiving the document to writing the letter took only three hours. Yao Wenyuan raised Mao Zedong's commentary on the <Water Margin> to the level of line struggle, and considered it to be of positive significance in preventing and combating revisionism.The Beijing newspapers were indeed very enthusiastic about the review of <Water Margin>, mainly in the Yao Wenyuan-controlled <Red Flag> magazine and the <People's Daily>.September 12, Jiang Qing ran to the Dazhai, sent a series of feelings, what Song Jiang over Chao Gai, now there is no one to overthrow Chairman Mao ah, she thinks there is.Hu Qiaomu reported Jiang Qing's speech in Dazhai to Deng Xiaoping, arguing that Jiang Qing's speech in Dazhai was an \"insinuation of Deng Xiaoping\".Deng Xiaoping did not see any action except passing Jiang Qing's speech in Dazhai to Mao Zedong, and I should say he was also in a state of quiet observation.It seems that Mao Zedong also has no intention of expanding the problem of commenting on <Water Margin>, and the commentary on <Water Margin> was hastily concluded.\"Up to this point, Mao, who was in the highest position, still wanted the two sides to compromise and cooperate."

 prc70s.100.d:0 "On November 2, Mao Yuanxin reported to Mao Zedong. Mao Yuanxin said when talking about his estimation of the current situation\:\"How do we look at the Cultural Revolution, the mainstream, the tributaries, the ten fingers, thirty-seven or reverse thirty-seven, affirmative or negative?\"And he said\:\"For the Cultural Revolution, there is a wind that seems to be more aggressive than in 1972 when the Cultural Revolution was denied by criticizing the extreme left.\"I am worried about the Central Committee, fearing a recurrence. I pay close attention to Comrade Xiaoping's speech, I feel a problem, he rarely speaks of the achievements of the Cultural Revolution, rarely mentioned the criticism of Liu Shaoqi revisionist line.\"Three instructions as an outline\",In fact, there is only one instruction left, that is, to produce it.Mao Zedong affirmed Mao Yuanxin's view, saying\:\"There are two attitudes, one is dissatisfied with the Cultural Revolution. The second is to settle accounts, to settle the accounts of the Cultural Revolution.\"Mao Zedong proposed to hold a small-scale meeting to talk about the above opinions to Deng Xiaoping himself.In early November, Mao Zedong sent Mao Yuanxin to Deng Xiaoping's residence in Dongjiaominxiang Alley to talk to Deng Xiaoping, and the talks fell apart at once.When Mao Yuanxin left, Deng Xiaoping did not see him off. Mao Yuanxin reported on his conversation with Deng Xiaoping, and Mao Zedong asked Mao Yuanxin to find Wang Dongxing, Chen Xilian and Deng Xiaoping to talk together.After Mao Yuanxin's speech, Deng Xiaoping said that he started to grasp the work from the No. 9 document in March this year, and presided over the work of the Central Committee in July.From the 9th document after the national situation is a little better, or worse, he and Mao Yuanxin's views are different.But Deng Xiaoping's attitude was tough, but he said he was willing to make a review.On November 3 and 4, in accordance with Mao Zedong's instructions, Mao Yuanxin, Chen Xilian, Wang Dongxing, Li Xiannian, Ji Dengkui, Hua Guofeng and Zhang Chunqiao talked to Deng Xiaoping.At the meeting, Zhang Chunqiao criticized Deng Xiaoping\:\"Liu Bing sent the letter to you because you and Liu Bing's position, feelings have some consistency.\"Mao Zedong still stressed the need to help Deng Xiaoping, asking the meeting to expand a few more people, but \"do not tell Jiang Qing, nothing to say\".Although Mao Zedong had been strongly supportive of Deng Xiaoping in the economic field, he could not tolerate Deng's series of rectification, which was in danger of negating the Cultural Revolution.So he wanted to use Deng Xiaoping, but also to knock, so he took Liu Bing's letter as a trigger to carry out the \"criticism of Deng, counteracting the right-leaning reversal of the wind\"campaign."
