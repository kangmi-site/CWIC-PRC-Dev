At present, the Party and the government should lead this campaign resolutely and actively, and in the spring and summer of this year develop this campaign to all places in the country where socialist ownership has basically been transformed, and really reach the level of household awareness and everyone's hands.\nThe elimination of flies, mosquitoes, rats and sparrows is an important step in our conquest of diseases and the elimination of pests and animals and birds that harm human beings. We must conquer not only human diseases, but also diseases, pests and animal pests of livestock, poultry and crops. This struggle is an important aspect of the great war of mankind to conquer nature and transform it, and an important aspect of the great cultural revolution of our people to turn sickness and weakness into health and strength, and backwardness into advancement."

Although in farming areas, it is harmful to eat grains, but in cities, parks, mountains, forest areas, it is doubtful whether it is equally harmful. In the agricultural development program on the elimination of the four pests, it says that the sparrow should be eliminated in all possible places. For the sake of clarity, it seems that it should be changed to eliminate sparrow pests in all places where sparrows are likely to be a pest.\nHowever, there are some biologists who support the elimination of the four pests, such as Zhou Jianren, a biologist who is the vice minister of the Ministry of Education, who concluded from his own experience in the countryside as a child that "there is no need to doubt that sparrows are pests" and that \"pests should be exterminated without hesitation\".

Only with the promotion of the contract system can we mobilize the cadres and fire all those who are not active.\nComrade Liu Shaoqi also believes that the current agricultural system also has huge problems, our rural students are not mobilized, do not read too much, anyway, more is not useful. To promote work and study, so that students do not rely on their families, rely on their own to try to pay the tuition fees. Thirteen-year-olds should do at least four hours of manual labor a day, and nine-year-olds should take two hours a day to clean toilets and cut pig grass.

Liu Shaoqi began to send working groups into schools to \"lead\" the movement, and all schools began to suspend classes. On the same day, Liu Shaoqi presided over the formulation of a strategy to limit the Cultural Revolution movement. On June 13, the enlarged meeting of the Politburo decided to send working groups to the whole country. After the working group entered the schools, it cracked down on the rebels and protected the conservatives, and began to brutally suppress the Cultural Revolution. In order to lead the movement to the bureaucratic track, the working group also cracked down on a large number of cadres and persecuted ordinary students, which was the \"50 Days of White Terror\". The \"50 days of white terror\" and the bureaucratic repression made a large group of young people really see the direction of the revolution, and they decided that Mao stood for anti-oppression and anti-persecution, for turning over and liberating themselves, and for \"justifying the rebellion\". At this point, the political integration between the Central Cultural Revolutionaries and the grassroots rebels began to take shape. On July 28, 1966, Mao Zedong instructed that the working groups in the school should be abolished."

At that time, Beijing was characterized by the fact that, except for the criticism meetings organized by the Central Cultural Revolution against high-ranking officials, which were an opportunity for the rebels to vent their anger and violence, the groups mainly used their own tabloids to engage in verbal battles and fierce refutations of each other. This made Beijing seem to be a model of the Cultural Revolution\'s \"civil struggle, not military struggle\" (only within the Red Guards, of course). However, in early 1968, the struggle between the \"Jinggangshan\" and \"April 14\" factions in Tsinghua University finally led to a big martial fight. During the struggle, Tsinghua University made use of the conditions of a polytechnic university to make its own pistols, grenades, spears, and earth tanks, and even dug tunnels and fortifications on the campus, which caused serious damage. The most serious one was in the early morning of May 30, 1968, when Kuai Dafu organized the \"General Command of Tsinghua University Jinggang Mountain Corps\" to attack the opposing student organizations, resulting in 18 deaths and over 1,100 injuries.

On July 7, 1967, the two factions clashed at the Hongyan Diesel Plant, killing nine people and injuring 200 others. This was the first time that guns and bullets were used, and it was later called \"the first shot of Chongqing\'s armed struggle\". From then on, the armed struggle in Chongqing escalated, and the army also split up to participate in the struggle, with the 54th Army giving the most powerful support to the \"8-15\" faction. From the use of small caliber rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, heavy machine guns and hand grenades to the use of tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships, from alley battles to field battles, the scale became larger and larger, and more and more people died. From the summer of 1967 to the summer of 1968, there were 31 armed battles between the two factions of the Chongqing rebel groups, and 24 armed battles with guns, tanks, gunboats and other armaments. 645 people died from various causes. The oldest of the dead was 60 years old and the youngest was 14 years old.

Wang Hongwen, in spite of the opposition of most people in the headquarters of the General Department of Labour, firmly advocated the absorption of all Red Guards into the rebellion. This proved to be effective in deconstructing the oppositions of the rebels emotionally and organizationally, greatly reducing the resistance of the rebels against the opposition and lowering the cost of social integration of the rebels. Since the Kangping Road Incident, a large number of conservatives in Shanghai joined the rebellion, which led to the complete collapse of the conservative forces and the rebellion unified the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. The Kangping Road Incident was the first large-scale mass conflict between the two factions in the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, and was later classified as the first large-scale conflict in the country. Since the rebels only aimed to expel the Red Guards from the Kangping Road compound, and the Red Guards had always opposed martial arts, they did not resist fiercely; in addition, both sides who entered the compound had bare hands and fists, so the conflict basically stopped at pushing and pulling.

The purpose was to stop martial fighting in the schools and promote the unification of the two factions. The group led by Kuai Dafu resisted the Labor Propaganda Team, killing five workers and injuring many workers and PLA in more than ten hours, which directly shocked the central government. Kuai Dafu, who was considered to be the most loyal to the Central Committee\'s Cultural Revolution, had a violent conflict with the top brass. The situation had developed to such a point that Mao thought it was time to show the differences between the Central Cultural Revolutionaries and the rebels and to end the Cultural Revolution, which had reached a dead end. Mao summoned the five leaders of the Red Guards in Beijing in the early hours of July 28 to criticize the militant students\' armed struggle and resistance, and the Cultural Revolution movement in colleges and universities changed direction from then on.\" But on the whole, Mao was still protective of the students in colleges and universities. It was hoped that under the leadership of the working class, through education and labor exercises in grassroots units, rebellious students would be promoted to combine with workers and peasants and transform their own sectarianism and hilltopism.

Some demanded that the old government bureaucrats not be accepted at all. Zhao desperately wanted to remain within the nascent Yunnan Revolutionary Committee and tried to maintain his position through the rebel groups. Zhao tried to maintain his own power by supporting the rebels, and the situation tended to be characterized by renewed armed fighting, which he repeatedly provoked, leading to an expansion of the problem of local deaths and injuries, and then was sued and attacked by the opposition for deliberately destabilizing the border areas and suspected of colluding with the Kuomintang and rebel forces .

Only five provinces and cities in the country, namely Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Guizhou, supported the rebel faction. Most local military regions opposed the radical political ideas and demands of the rebels, while the rebels were discontented with the army\'s conservative stance. This conflict spread from the grassroots to the top. The army generals opposed the full implementation of the Cultural Revolution within the army, while the rebel faction\'s aggressive actions against the powers that be in the \"criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line\" led to the defeat of a large number of cadres. At a meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai on February 14, members of the army conservatives argued face to face with the Cultural Revolutionaries. After holding seven consecutive political life meetings, the Central Politburo criticized the old cadres in the name of \"bourgeois restoration and counter-current\". After that, the Central Politburo stopped its activities and the Central Cultural Revolution Group took its place. At the same time, Jiang Qing and other people started a massive wave of counteraction against the \"February counter-current\" in the society. It was the conservative stance of the army that made the Cultural Revolution conservative in early 1967 after the upsurge of 1966. In February and March, from the grassroots to the top, the army all over the country showed a strong anti-Cultural Revolution orientation, either by supporting the conservatives to suppress the rebels or by \"pulling one faction and fighting another\". They either supported the conservatives in suppressing the rebellion, or by \"pulling one faction and fighting another\", they widened the differences within the rebellion and caused a split, thus reviving the conservative organizations. In short, the army clashed violently with the rebels, or at least with the radical wing of the rebels. This was the \"February Backlash\" and the \"March Black Wind\". The local army began to suppress and even bloodily suppress the rebellious masses."

He Long\'s food expenses started at about 80 yuan per month, and He Long\'s monthly food standard at that time was equivalent to the sum of 6 soldiers. After some time, He Long was too much pasta, so he wrote directly to Chairman Mao, saying that he was from the south and loved to eat rice, and that the food should be adjusted. Chairman Mao received He Long\'s letter, specifically instructed to the central authorities:\"He Long has merit in the past, to take care of the arrangement of He Long\'s life, according to 200 yuan per month living expenses standard\". This instruction was also issued to the whole party as a central document, requiring all old cadres to be well taken care of. After Chairman Mao\'s instruction, He Long\'s life got better. The company specially researched and formulated He Long\'s weekly recipes, which were basically the same throughout the week, with four dishes and one soup at every meal. Sometimes it is not enough to eat, mountains and seafood, chicken, duck, fish, pork liver and pig\'s trotters, which is not less. The deputy squad leader often seeks He Long\'s opinion, he said what he wants to eat to get what. A month 200 yuan, he alone is equivalent to 16 soldiers\' food costs. At that time, pork 0.5 yuan per pound, He Long\'s food is good to the zenith up.

Because from this time onwards, several places of the embassy and consulate have been under the surveillance of the military police, ordinary people in and out of the inquiry arrested, officials in and out of the car are jeeps tracking surveillance.\nAt about 10:00 a.m. the next day, tens of thousands of thugs from all walks of life entered the Yangon city area where the Chinese were concentrated one by one. The Chinese gathering area was targeted for destruction, looting and burning, making this Chinese exclusion culminate. The Burmese government also played a two-faced game behind the scenes:on the one hand, it commanded soldiers who had taken off their uniforms as the backbone of the mob, and on the other hand, it used the face of the masses to destroy and burn, shirking its responsibility.

At night, the city of Rangoon was filled with troops and the streets were filled with random shootings and killings. After the Burmese government's ulterior motive of incitement, all Burmese people had a varying degree of Chinese hatred. The campaign caused a large number of Chinese to leave the country, the loss of Chinese property was even more incalculable, and stirred up hatred against the Chinese and intensified the persecution of them, with extremely bad effects."

  prc_war_Jumbo_Island.5.d:0 "At 4:10 a.m. Moscow time on March 2, the Chinese authorities organized an armed detachment to infiltrate Damansky Island in the Ussuri River section of our border guard, which our border guards discovered and ordered to leave immediately, however, instead of listening to them, the Chinese troops fired at our border guards. The brave soldiers immediately returned fire and drove the enemy back to its territory.\nAfter the clash on March 2, we stepped up our border defense forces to prepare for the next enemy attack, and on March 14, the enemy organized a larger attack. Our border guards were already on the alert and dealt the enemy a head-on blow. The enemy suffered numerous dead and wounded, chauvinist mad soldiers ran for their lives, and the ice was littered with dropped bodies. Now Damansky Island has been cleared of the enemy and the island is under the full control of the heroic Soviet armed forces.\nAfter the war there was a medal ceremony, and more than 250 border guards received medals. Among them were Nikolai Popov, Anatoly Kryga, Viktor Sanzarov and others. The Soviet hero V.D. Bubenina commanded a 23-man border guard unit in an armored personnel carrier that eliminated 248 enemies.\nThere are also heroes who have left us forever, I. I. Strelnikov died in the battle to cover his comrades at the gunpoint of the invaders on March 2. We will never forget and will make the chauvinist traitors pay in blood!\nWe hope that the Chinese people will never forget our selfless help, and that we will always have the strongest friendship with the Chinese people in general. We call on the Chinese people to join us in our march to fight for the communist cause and to defeat the traitor of the working class, Mao Zedong!"

  prc_war_Jumbo_Island.6.d:0 "The situation escalated rapidly, and on March 2, according to reports in the Communist People's Daily and Soviet Pravda, clashes erupted between China and the Soviet Union in the border area known as Jumbo Island (known as Damansky Island in the Soviet Union) at 46°29'1.19" N 133°50'39.03" E. Both sides have stated that the other side is primarily responsible for this conflict. In fact, this is a continuation of the continuous deterioration of bilateral relations between the two sides since 1960. The fragile balance between the Chinese and Soviet armies on the long border between China and the Soviet Union, against the backdrop of ideological and national interest disputes and the so-called "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" underway in mainland China, was finally broken and the two sides exchanged fire. The losses on both sides are not yet clear.\nOur special observers believe it is highly likely that the conflict at Jumbo Island will continue and erupt at multiple points along the border. Neither China nor the Soviet Union has ruled out the possibility that the war will expand further at this time. As of the date of this article, neither side has shown any willingness to engage in diplomatic consultations.\nA conflict between the two communist powers would inevitably further divide the communist camp and intensify the blockade of the Communist Party. Neither the U.S. government nor NATO has made any comment on the incident at this time."
